This case study revolves around developing a logistic regression model for lead scoring, aiming to assign lead scores between 0 and 100 to potential customers. The dataset comprises various features such as lead origin, source, website interaction metrics, etc. Initial exploration uncovered missing values in some columns, which were addressed through imputation and replacement techniques.

After preprocessing, including dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables, the dataset underwent an 80-20 split for training and testing. Features were scaled using StandardScaler, and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV optimized the logistic regression model, achieving an accuracy of 94.06% on the training set.

Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve were used to assess model performance. The model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with an AUC of 0.94 on the ROC curve.

While the logistic regression model showed promise in predicting lead conversion, recommendations for further analysis include exploring additional feature engineering techniques and alternative models. Regular model monitoring and updates are essential to adapt to changing business requirements.

In conclusion, the logistic regression model provides valuable insights into lead scoring, enabling the company to effectively prioritize and target potential customers, thus enhancing overall business efficiency.
